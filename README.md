# SnakeGame
This is my implementation of the game "Snake"

## Project Description:
Develop a Win32 based version of the game "Snake" with a pathfinding algorithm for the player to compete with. The project includes three game modes, single player, computer player, and player vs computer. The pathfinding uses an altered version of the A* pathfinding algorithm and an algorithm to create a Hamilton cycle with maximum turns on a square grid to safely get apples.
